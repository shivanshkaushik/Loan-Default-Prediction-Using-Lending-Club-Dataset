# Loan-Default-Prediction-Using-Lending-Club-Dataset
Here, Loan data from the American P2P firm, Lending Club was used to build a predictor that predicts if a loan will default or not.
The dataset contains the data about the entire lifecycle of a loan but in this project, only the data available to the underwriter at the time of loan application is used so as to not leak information from the future.
